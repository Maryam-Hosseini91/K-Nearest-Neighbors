# K-Nearest-Neighbors
KNN, which stands for k-nearest neighbors, is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a non-parametric method that makes predictions based on the similarity of new data points to existing labeled data points.

In KNN, the "k" represents the number of nearest neighbors that will be considered for making predictions. When a new data point is to be classified, the algorithm finds the k nearest neighbors in the training set based on a distance metric (usually Euclidean distance) and assigns the new data point to the class that is most common among its neighbors. For regression tasks, the algorithm takes the average or weighted average of the target values of the k nearest neighbors to predict the value of the new data point.

Here's a step-by-step overview of the KNN algorithm:

1. Load the training data: The algorithm starts by loading the labeled training data, which consists of input features and corresponding target labels or values.

2. Choose a value for k: Determine the number of neighbors (k) that will be considered for predictions.

3. Calculate distances: For a new data point, calculate the distance between that point and all other data points in the training set using a distance metric (typically Euclidean distance). The distance can be calculated based on the values of the input features.

4. Find the k nearest neighbors: Select the k data points with the smallest distances to the new data point.

5. Make predictions: For classification, assign the class label that is most common among the k nearest neighbors to the new data point. For regression, take the average or weighted average of the target values of the k nearest neighbors to predict the value of the new data point.

KNN is a lazy learning algorithm, meaning that it does not make any explicit assumptions about the underlying data distribution. Instead, it memorizes the training data and uses it during the prediction phase. It can work well when the training set is large and the decision boundaries are complex.

However, KNN has some limitations. It can be computationally expensive when dealing with large datasets since it requires calculating distances to all training data points. It is also sensitive to the choice of k and the distance metric used. Additionally, KNN may struggle with high-dimensional data or when the feature scales are not properly normalized.

Overall, KNN is a versatile algorithm that can be applied to various machine learning tasks, but it's important to consider its strengths and weaknesses when deciding to use it in a particular scenario.
